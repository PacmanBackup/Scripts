 This repo contains my bash scripts in all stages of development.

I recently added the game.sh and tweak.sh files after seeing this post on r/linux_gaming: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/8j0evj/tuning_your_linux_system_for_gaming_performance/ portions of this code were borrowed from the user sn0w75.
